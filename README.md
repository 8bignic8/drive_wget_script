# Googledrive_wget_script
This is a smal script to help downloading data from google drive via wget

#Start

Linux or terminal 

git clone https://github.com/8bignic8/drive_wget_script

cd drive_wget_script

Start this script in your terminal with

It downloads in the folder you are in so if you want to download in an other folder just start the script in that foler or move the data later
